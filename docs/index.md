****Clarifications and thoughts:***
 Again,I am using the brackets in this example as a visual label/identifier, not as a part of the actual command.
1) The request type portion `{set | info}` should be read as, `{set OR info}` "This is either setting a role to my name, or is requesting information be shown"

2) The `<value>` would be a mandatory input, whilst `(option)` would be optional.

Pros: 
*-Provides predictable structure
- Helps avoid confusing MBTI and socionics
- New can be added and organized with ease, organizationally (scalability) 

Cons (debateable)
- Longer command format may be harder to remember 
- Less familiarity for accustumed members 
- Potentially less specific since it adheres to "structure first command name second"*

Note: *There can be ootentially infinite alternatives to theae, though these would represent main structure. Also, cureent command list wouldnt need tk be disabled, though it would help in quicking any a potentially confusing transition process imo*
